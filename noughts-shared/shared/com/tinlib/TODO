Injector
  - consider making singleton keys the default
  - make it possible to bind a "listener" type class eagerly
  - maybe make eager initialization the default/only option?
  - tests

Bus
  - Improve the system for waiting on multiple internal keys, which sometimes have no associated object
  - Bring back the post/produce distinction
  - Handle invalidations better -- if you're waiting to fire a one-off action and the game_id changes,
    you need to abort that, not fire with the new game id
  - Handle errors better when you're waiting on multiple keys
  - tests

TestHelper
  - Just use bindInstance directly
  - Figure out a better system for cleanup logic
  - Figure out why tests sometimes fail together but pass in isolation
  - tests

EntityGenerator
  - Integrate it with the build process
  - Add support for extensions
  - Add support for packages
  - Generally clean up the code
  - tests

GameList
  - Rewrite the tests to rely less on storing junk in class fields
